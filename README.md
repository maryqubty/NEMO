# NEMO: Neuroevolution-Enhanced Multi-Objective Optimization for Mixed-Precision Quantization
This repository is dedicated to our seminar project in deep learning, where we thoroughly reviewed and summarized a paper presented in Boston, MA, USA, from July 9 to 13, 2022.
We delved into the fascinating topic of Neuroevolution-Enhanced Multi-Objective Optimization for Mixed-Precision Quantization. 
Feel free to explore our findings!
